Version 2.0
===========

    Glances v2.0 is not a simple upgrade of the version 1.x but a complete code refactoring.
    Based on a plugins system, it aims at providing an easy way to add news features.
    - Core defines the basics and commons functions.
    - all stats are grabbed through plugins (see the glances/plugins source folder).
    - also outputs methods (Curse, Web mode, CSV) are managed as plugins.

    The Curse interface is almost the same than the version 1.7. Some improvements have been made:
    - space optimisation for the CPU, LOAD and MEM stats (justified alignment)
    - CPU:
        . CPU stats are displayed as soon as Glances is started
        . steal CPU alerts are no more logged
    - LOAD:
        . 5 min LOAD alerts are no more logged
    - File System:
        . Display the device name (if space is available)
    - Sensors:
        . Sensors and HDD temperature are displayed in the same block
    - Process list:
        . Refactor columns: CPU%, MEM%, VIRT, RES, PID, USER, NICE, STATUS, TIME, IO, Command/name
        . The running processes status is highlighted
        . The process name is highlighted in the command line

    Glances 2.0 brings a brand new Web Interface. You can run Glances in Web server mode and
    consult the stats directly from a standard Web Browser.

    The client mode can now fallback to a simple SNMP mode if Glances server is not found on the remote machine.

    Complete release notes:
    * Cut ifName and DiskName if they are too long in the curses interface (by Nicolargo)
    * Windows CLI is OK but early experimental (by Nicolargo)
    * Add bitrate limits to the networks interfaces (by Nicolargo)
