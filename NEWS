      or by pressing the ENTER key in the curse interface.
      For the moment, process filter feature is only available in standalone mode.
    * Add extended processes informations for top process
      Top process stats availables: CPU affinity, extended memory information (shared, text, lib, datat, dirty, swap), open threads/files and TCP/UDP network sessions, IO nice level
      For the moment, extended processes stats are only available in standalone mode.
    * Add --process-short-name tag and '/' key to switch between short/command line
    * Create a max_processes key in the configuration file
      The goal is to reduce the number of displayed processes in the curses UI and
      so limit the CPU footprint of the Glances standalone mode.
      The API always return all the processes, the key is only active in the curses UI.
      If the key is not define, all the processes will be displayed.
      The default value is 20 (processes displayed).
      For the moment, this feature is only available in standalone mode.
    * Alias for network interfaces, disks and sensors
      Users can configure alias from the Glances configuration file.
    * Add Glances log message (in the /tmp/glances.log file)
      The default log level is INFO, you can switch to the DEBUG mode using the -d option on the command line.
    * Add RESTFul API to the Web server mode
      RestFul API doc: https://github.com/nicolargo/glances/wiki/The-Glances-RESTFULL-JSON-API
    * Improve SNMP fallback mode for Cisco IOS, VMware ESXi
    * Add --theme-white feature to optimize display for white background
    * Experimental history feature (--enable-history option on the command line)
      This feature allows users to generate graphs within the curse interface.
      Graphs are available for CPU, LOAD and MEM.
      To generate graph, click on the 'g' key.
      To reset the history, press the 'r' key.
      Note: This feature uses the matplotlib library.
    * CI: Improve Travis coverage

Bugs corrected:

    * Quitting glances leaves a column layout to the current terminal (issue #392)
    * Glances crashes with malformed UTF-8 sequences in process command lines (issue #391)
    * SNMP fallback mode is not Python 3 compliant (issue #386)

Version 2.0
===========

    Glances v2.0 is not a simple upgrade of the version 1.x but a complete code refactoring.
    Based on a plugins system, it aims at providing an easy way to add new features.
    - Core defines the basics and commons functions.
    - all stats are grabbed through plugins (see the glances/plugins source folder).
    - also outputs methods (Curse, Web mode, CSV) are managed as plugins.

    The Curse interface is almost the same than the version 1.7. Some improvements have been made:
    - space optimisation for the CPU, LOAD and MEM stats (justified alignment)
    - CPU:
        . CPU stats are displayed as soon as Glances is started
        . steal CPU alerts are no more logged
    - LOAD:
        . 5 min LOAD alerts are no more logged
    - File System:
        . Display the device name (if space is available)
    - Sensors:
        . Sensors and HDD temperature are displayed in the same block
    - Process list:
        . Refactor columns: CPU%, MEM%, VIRT, RES, PID, USER, NICE, STATUS, TIME, IO, Command/name
        . The running processes status is highlighted
        . The process name is highlighted in the command line

    Glances 2.0 brings a brand new Web Interface. You can run Glances in Web server mode and
    consult the stats directly from a standard Web Browser.

    The client mode can now fallback to a simple SNMP mode if Glances server is not found on the remote machine.
