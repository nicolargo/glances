      * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
      * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)

    2. If you have a fix, that is most welcome -- please attach or summarize it in your message!

    3. We will evaluate the vulnerability and, if necessary, release a fix or mitigating steps to address it. We will contact you to let you know the outcome, and will credit you in the report.
