"""Glances v5 threshold engine — pure functional `_levels` computation.

`f(value, thresholds, direction) -> "ok" | "careful" | "warning" | "critical"`

Consumed by `GlancesPluginBase._derived_parameters()` to populate the
`_levels` dict written to the StatsStore. `GlancesAlerts` (Phase 1.4)
reads `_levels` from the store but **never recomputes thresholds** —
this module is the single source of truth for level computation.

See architecture decisions §3.3.

    Three key patterns are supported, walked from most specific to least

    1. ``<pk_value>_<field>_<level>``  — per-item, per-field (e.g.
       ``wlan0_bytes_recv_warning``). Requires both ``field`` and
       ``pk_value`` to be provided.
    2. ``<field>_<level>``             — per-field, all items (e.g.
       ``bytes_recv_warning``). Requires ``field``.
    3. ``<level>``                     — applies to any watched field
       (e.g. ``warning``).

    Per-level defaults (from the field schema's ``default_thresholds``)
    are used when none of the three keys are configured. Layering is
    per-key — the user can override only one level and keep the others
    at their declared defaults.

    A negative value in the config is treated as "absent" so users can
    explicitly disable a level by setting ``careful=-1``.
