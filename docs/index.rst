Glances
=======

Glances is a cross-platform monitoring tool that aims to present
maximum information in minimal space through either a curses-based
or Web-based interface. It can dynamically adapt the displayed
information depending on the terminal size.

It can also work in client/server mode. Remote monitoring can be
done via terminal, Web interface, or API (XMLRPC and RESTful).

Stats can also be exported to :ref:`files or external databases<gw>`.

It is also possible to use it in your own Python scripts thanks to
the :ref:`Glances API<api>` or in any other application through
the :ref:`RESTful API<api_restful>`.
