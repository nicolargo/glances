API (Restfull/JSON) documentation
=================================

This documentation describes the Glances API version 4 (Restfull/JSON) interface.

For Glances version 3, please have a look on:
``https://github.com/nicolargo/glances/blob/support/glancesv3/docs/api.rst``

Run the Glances API server
--------------------------

The Glances Restfull/API server could be ran using the following command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    # glances -w --disable-webui

It is also ran automatically when Glances is started in Web server mode (-w).

If you want to enable the Glances Central Browser, use:

.. code-block:: bash

    # glances -w --browser --disable-webui

API URL
-------

The default root API URL is ``http://localhost:61208/api/4``.

The bind address and port could be changed using the ``--bind`` and ``--port`` command line options.

It is also possible to define an URL prefix using the ``url_prefix`` option from the [outputs] section
of the Glances configuration file.

Note: The url_prefix should always end with a slash (``/``).

For example:

.. code-block:: ini
    [outputs]
    url_prefix = /glances/

will change the root API URL to ``http://localhost:61208/glances/api/4`` and the Web UI URL to
``http://localhost:61208/glances/``

API documentation URL
---------------------

The API documentation is embeded in the server and available at the following URL:
``http://localhost:61208/docs#/``.

WebUI refresh
-------------

It is possible to change the Web UI refresh rate (default is 2 seconds) using the following option in the URL:
``http://localhost:61208/?refresh=5``


GET API status
--------------

This entry point should be used to check the API status.
It will the Glances version and a 200 return code if everything is OK.

GET wifi
--------

Get plugin stats::

    # curl http://localhost:61208/api/4/wifi
    [{"key": "ssid",
      "quality_level": -68.0,
      "quality_link": 42.0,
      "ssid": "wlp0s20f3"}]

Get a specific field::

    # curl http://localhost:61208/api/4/wifi/ssid
    {"ssid": ["wlp0s20f3"]}

Get a specific item when field matches the given value::

    # curl http://localhost:61208/api/4/wifi/ssid/value/wlp0s20f3
    {"wlp0s20f3": [{"key": "ssid",
                    "quality_level": -68.0,
                    "quality_link": 42.0,
                    "ssid": "wlp0s20f3"}]}

GET all stats
-------------

Get all Glances stats::

    # curl http://localhost:61208/api/4/all
    Return a very big dictionary (avoid using this request, performances will be poor)...

GET top n items of a specific plugin
------------------------------------

Get top 2 processes of the processlist plugin::

    # curl http://localhost:61208/api/4/processlist/top/2
    []

Note: Only work for plugin with a list of items

GET item description
--------------------
Get item description (human readable) for a specific plugin/item::

    # curl http://localhost:61208/api/4/diskio/read_bytes/description
    "Number of bytes read."

Note: the description is defined in the fields_description variable of the plugin.

GET item unit
-------------
Get item unit for a specific plugin/item::

    # curl http://localhost:61208/api/4/diskio/read_bytes/unit
    "byte"

Note: the description is defined in the fields_description variable of the plugin.

GET stats history
-----------------

History of a plugin::

    # curl http://localhost:61208/api/4/cpu/history
    {"system": [["2024-12-28T09:06:48.521883", 2.7],
