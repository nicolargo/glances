API (Restfull/JSON) documentation
=================================

This documentation describes the Glances API version 4 (Restfull/JSON) interface.

An OpenAPI specification file is available at:
``https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicolargo/glances/refs/heads/develop/docs/openapi.json``

Run the Glances API server
--------------------------

The Glances Restfull/API server could be ran using the following command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    # glances -w --disable-webui

It is also ran automatically when Glances is started in Web server mode (-w).

If you want to enable the Glances Central Browser, use:

.. code-block:: bash

    # glances -w --browser --disable-webui

API URL
-------

The default root API URL is ``http://localhost:61208/api/4``.

The bind address and port could be changed using the ``--bind`` and ``--port`` command line options.

It is also possible to define an URL prefix using the ``url_prefix`` option from the [outputs] section
of the Glances configuration file.

Note: The url_prefix should always end with a slash (``/``).

For example:

.. code-block:: ini
    [outputs]
    url_prefix = /glances/

will change the root API URL to ``http://localhost:61208/glances/api/4`` and the Web UI URL to
``http://localhost:61208/glances/``

API documentation URL
---------------------

The API documentation is embeded in the server and available at the following URL:
``http://localhost:61208/docs#/``.

WebUI refresh
-------------

It is possible to change the Web UI refresh rate (default is 2 seconds) using the following option in the URL:
``http://localhost:61208/?refresh=5``


GET API status
--------------

This entry point should be used to check the API status.
It will the Glances version and a 200 return code if everything is OK.
