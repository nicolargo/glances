Introduction
============

Glances is a cross-platform curses-based system monitoring tool which
aims to present a maximum of information in a minimum of space, ideally
to fit in a classical 80x24 terminal or higher to have additional
information. It can adapt dynamically the displayed information depending
on the terminal size.

Glances can also work in client/server mode. Remote monitoring could be
done via terminal or web interface.

Glances is written in Python and uses the `psutil`_ library to get
information from your system.

Usage
=====

Standalone Mode
---------------

Simply run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ glances

Client/Server Mode
------------------

If you want to remotely monitor a machine, called ``server``, from
another one, called ``client``, just run on the server:

.. code-block:: console

    server$ glances -s

and on the client:

.. code-block:: console

    client$ glances -c @server

where ``@server`` is the IP address or hostname of the server.

Glances can centralize available Glances servers using the ``--browser``
option. The server list can be statically defined in the Glances
configuration file (section ``[serverlist]``).

Glances can also detect and display all Glances servers available on your
network (auto-discover mode is based on the the ``zeroconf`` protocol,
which is only available on GNU/Linux and OS X):

.. code-block:: console

    client$ glances --browser

It is possible to disable the auto discover mode ``--disable-autodiscover``.

In server mode, you can set the bind address ``-B ADDRESS`` and listening
TCP port ``-p PORT``.

In client mode, you can set the TCP port of the server ``-p PORT``.

You can set a password to access to the server ``--password``.

Default binding address is ``0.0.0.0`` (Glances will listen on all the
available network interfaces) and TCP port is ``61209``.

In client/server mode, limits are set by the server side.

Glances is ``IPv6`` compatible. Just use the ``-B ::`` option to bind to
all IPv6 addresses.

As an experimental feature, if Glances server is not detected by the
client, the latter will try to grab stats using the ``SNMP`` protocol:

.. code-block:: console

    client$ glances -c @snmpserver

*Note*: stats grabbed by SNMP request are limited (OS dependent).

Web Server Mode
---------------

If you want to remotely monitor a machine, called ``server``, from any
device with a web browser, just run the server with the ``-w`` option:

.. code-block:: console

    server$ glances -w

and on the client enter the following URL in your favorite web browser:

::

    http://@server:61208

where ``@server`` is the IP address or hostname of the server.

To change the refresh rate of the page, just add the period in seconds
at the end of the URL. For example, to refresh the page every 10s:

::

    http://@server:61208/10

The Glances web interface follows responsive web design principles.

Configuration
=============

No configuration file is mandatory to use Glances.

Furthermore a configuration file is needed to modify limit alerts, to
set up monitored processes list, to hide disks or network interfaces or
to define alias.

Location
--------

You can put the configuration file ``glances.conf`` in the following
locations:

:Linux: ``~/.config/glances, /etc/glances``
:\*BSD: ``~/.config/glances, /usr/local/etc/glances``
:OS X: ``~/Library/Application Support/glances, /usr/local/etc/glances``
:Windows: ``%APPDATA%\glances``

On Windows XP, the ``%APPDATA%`` path is:

::

    C:\Documents and Settings\<User>\Application Data

Since Windows Vista and newer versions:

::

    C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Roaming

User-specific options override system-wide options and options given on
the command line override either.

Syntax
------

Each plugin and export module can have a section.

Example for the CPU plugin:

.. code-block::

    [cpu]
    user_careful=50
    user_warning=70
    user_critical=90
    iowait_careful=50
    iowait_warning=70
    iowait_critical=90
    system_careful=50
    system_warning=70
    system_critical=90
    steal_careful=50
    steal_warning=70
    steal_critical=90

By default the ``steal`` CPU time alerts aren't logged. If you want to
enable log/alert, just add:

.. code-block::

    steal_log=True

Logs and debug mode
===================

Glances logs all its internal messages to a log file. By default, only
INFO & WARNING & ERROR &CRITICAL levels are logged, but DEBUG messages
can ben logged using the -d option on the command line.

By default, the log file is under:

:Linux, \*BSD, OS X: ``/tmp/glances.log``
:Windows: ``%APPDATA%\Local\temp\glances.log``

If ``glances.log`` is not writable, a new file will be created and
returned to the user console.

Anatomy Of The Application
==========================

Legend
------

| ``GREEN`` stat counter is ``"OK"``
| ``BLUE`` stat counter is ``"CAREFUL"``
| ``MAGENTA`` stat counter is ``"WARNING"``
| ``RED`` stat counter is ``"CRITICAL"``

*Note*: only stats with colored background will be logged in the alert
view.

Header
------

.. image:: images/header.png

The header shows the hostname, OS name, release version, platform
architecture and system uptime (on the upper right corner).
Additionally, on GNU/Linux, it also shows the kernel version.

In client mode, the server connection status is displayed.

Connected:

.. image:: images/connected.png

Disconnected:

.. image:: images/disconnected.png

QuickLook
---------

The ``quicklook`` plugin is only displayed on wide screen and propose a
bar view for CPU and memory (virtual and swap).

.. image:: images/quicklook.png

*Note*: limit values can be overwritten in the configuration file under
the ``[quicklook]`` section.

CPU
---

Short view:

.. image:: images/cpu.png

If enough horizontal space is available, extended CPU information are
displayed.

Extended view:

.. image:: images/cpu-wide.png

To switch to per-CPU stats, just hit the ``1`` key:

.. image:: images/per-cpu.png

The CPU stats are shown as a percentage and for the configured refresh
time. The total CPU usage is displayed on the first line.

| If user|system CPU is ``<50%``, then status is set to ``"OK"``
| If user|system CPU is ``>50%``, then status is set to ``"CAREFUL"``
| If user|system CPU is ``>70%``, then status is set to ``"WARNING"``
| If user|system CPU is ``>90%``, then status is set to ``"CRITICAL"``

*Note*: limit values can be overwritten in the configuration file under
the ``[cpu]`` and/or ``[percpu]`` sections.

Load
----

.. image:: images/load.png

On the *No Sheep* blog, *Zachary Tirrell* defines the load average [1]_:

    "In short it is the average sum of the number of processes
    waiting in the run-queue plus the number currently executing
    over 1, 5, and 15 minutes time periods."

Glances gets the number of CPU core to adapt the alerts.
Alerts on load average are only set on 15 minutes time period.
The first line also displays the number of CPU core.

| If load average is ``<0.7*core``, then status is set to ``"OK"``
| If load average is ``>0.7*core``, then status is set to ``"CAREFUL"``
| If load average is ``>1*core``, then status is set to ``"WARNING"``
| If load average is ``>5*core``, then status is set to ``"CRITICAL"``

*Note*: limit values can be overwritten in the configuration file under
the ``[load]`` section.

Memory
------

Glances uses two columns: one for the ``RAM`` and one for the ``SWAP``.

.. image:: images/mem.png

If enough space is available, Glances displays extended information for
the ``RAM``:

.. image:: images/mem-wide.png

Alerts are only set for used memory and used swap.

| If used memory|swap is ``<50%``, then status is set to ``"OK"``
| If used memory|swap is ``>50%``, then status is set to ``"CAREFUL"``
| If used memory|swap is ``>70%``, then status is set to ``"WARNING"``
| If used memory|swap is ``>90%``, then status is set to ``"CRITICAL"``

*Note*: limit values can be overwritten in the configuration file under
the ``[memory]`` and/or ``[memswap]`` sections.

Network
-------

.. image:: images/network.png

Glances displays the network interface bit rate. The unit is adapted
dynamically (bits per second, kbits per second, Mbits per second, etc).

Alerts are only set if the maximum speed per network interface is available
(see sample in the configuration file).

*Note*: it is possibile to define a list of network interfaces to hide
and per-interface limit values in the ``[network]`` section of the
configuration file and aliases for interface name.

Disk I/O
--------

.. image:: images/diskio.png

Glances displays the disk I/O throughput. The unit is adapted dynamically.

There is no alert on this information.

*Note*: it is possible to define a list of disks to hide under the
``[diskio]`` section in the configuration file and aliases for disk name.

File System
-----------

.. image:: images/fs.png

Glances displays the used and total file system disk space. The unit is
adapted dynamically.

Alerts are set for used disk space.

| If used disk is ``<50%``, then status is set to ``"OK"``
| If used disk is ``>50%``, then status is set to ``"CAREFUL"``
| If used disk is ``>70%``, then status is set to ``"WARNING"``
| If used disk is ``>90%``, then status is set to ``"CRITICAL"``

*Note*: limit values can be overwritten in the configuration file under
the ``[filesystem]`` section.

If a RAID controller is detected on you system, its status will be displayed:

.. image:: images/raid.png

By default, the plugin only displays physical devices (hard disks, USB
keys) and ignore all others. To allow others FS type, you have to use the
following section in the configuration file:

::

    [fs]
    allow=zfs,misc

Sensors
-------

Glances can displays the sensors information using `lm-sensors`,
`hddtemp` and `batinfo` [2]_.

All of the above libraries are available only on Linux.

As of lm-sensors, a filter is being applied in order to display
temperature only.

.. image:: images/sensors.png

There is no alert on this information.

*Note*: limit values and sensors alias names can be defined in the
configuration file under the ``[sensors]`` section.

Processes List
--------------

Compact view:

.. image:: images/processlist.png

Full view:

.. image:: images/processlist-wide.png

Three views are available for processes:

* Processes summary
* Optional monitored processes list (see below)
* Processes list

The processes summary line display:

* Tasks number (total number of processes)
* Threads number
* Running tasks number
* Sleeping tasks number
* Other tasks number (not running or sleeping)
* Sort key

By default, or if you hit the ``a`` key, the processes list is
automatically sorted by:

* ``CPU`` if there is no alert (default behavior)
* ``CPU`` if a CPU or LOAD alert is detected
* ``MEM`` if a memory alert is detected
* ``Disk I/O`` if a CPU iowait alert is detected

The number of processes in the list is adapted to the screen size.

``CPU%``
    % of CPU used by the process
``MEM%``
    % of MEM used by the process
``VIRT``
    Total program size - Virtual Memory Size (VMS)
``RES``
    Resident Set Size (RSS)
``PID``
    Process ID
``USER``
    User ID
``NI``
    Nice level of the process (niceness other than 0 is highlighted)
``S``
    Process status (running process is highlighted)
``TIME+``
    Cumulative CPU time used
``IOR/s``
    Per process I/O read rate (in Byte/s)
``IOW/s``
    Per process I/O write rate (in Byte/s)
``COMMAND``
    Process command line
    User cans switch to the process name by pressing on the ``/`` key

Process status legend:

``R``
    Running
``S``
    Sleeping (may be interrupted)
``D``
    Disk sleep (may not be interrupted)
``T``
    Traced / Stopped
``Z``
    Zombie

In standalone mode, additional informations are provided for the top
process:

.. image:: images/processlist-top.png

* CPU affinity (number of cores used by the process)
* Extended memory information (swap, shared, text, lib, data and dirty on Linux)
* Open threads, files and network sessions (TCP and UDP)
* IO nice level

The extended stats feature could be enabled using the ``--enable-process-extended``
option (command line) or the ``e`` key (curses interface).

*Note*: limit values can be overwritten in the configuration file under
the ``[process]`` section.

Monitored Processes List
------------------------

The monitored processes list allows user, through the configuration file,
to group processes and quickly show if the number of running processes is
not good.

.. image:: images/monitored.png

Each item is defined by:

* ``description``: description of the processes (max 16 chars).
* ``regex``: regular expression of the processes to monitor.
* ``command`` (optional): full path to shell command/script for extended
  stat. Should return a single line string. Use with caution.
* ``countmin`` (optional): minimal number of processes. A warning will
  be displayed if number of processes < count.
* ``countmax`` (optional): maximum number of processes. A warning will
  be displayed if number of processes > count.

Up to 10 items can be defined.

For example, if you want to monitor the Nginx processes on a Web server,
the following definition should do the job:

::

    [monitor]
    list_1_description=Nginx server
    list_1_regex=.*nginx.*
    list_1_command=nginx -v
    list_1_countmin=1
    list_1_countmax=4

If you also want to monitor the PHP-FPM daemon processes, you should add
another item:

::

    [monitor]
    list_1_description=Nginx server
    list_1_regex=.*nginx.*
    list_1_command=nginx -v
    list_1_countmin=1
    list_1_countmax=4
    list_2_description=PHP-FPM
    list_2_regex=.*php-fpm.*
    list_2_countmin=1
    list_2_countmax=20

In client/server mode, the list is defined on the server side.
A new method, called `getAllMonitored`, is available in the APIs and
get the JSON representation of the monitored processes list.

Alerts are set as following:

| If number of processes is 0, then status is set to ``"CRITICAL"``
| If number of processes is min < current < max, then status is set to ``"OK"``
| Else status is set to ``"WARNING"``

Logs
----

.. image:: images/logs.png

A log messages list is displayed in the bottom of the screen if (and
only if):

- at least one ``WARNING`` or ``CRITICAL`` alert was occurred
- space is available in the bottom of the console/terminal

Each alert message displays the following information:

1. start datetime
2. duration if alert is terminated or `ongoing` if the alert is still in
   progress
3. alert name
4. {min,avg,max} values or number of running processes for monitored
   processes list alerts

Docker
------

If you use ``Docker``, Glances can help you to monitor your container.
Glances uses the Docker API through the ``docker-py`` library.

.. image:: images/docker.png

Actions
-------

Glances can trigger actions on events.

By ``action``, we mean all shell command line. For example, if you want
to execute the ``foo.py`` script if the last 5 minutes load are critical
then add the action line to the Glances configuration file:

.. code-block::

    [load]
    critical=5.0
    critical_action=python /path/to/foo.py

All the stats are available in the command line through the use of the
``{{mustache}}`` syntax. Another example would be to create a log file
containing used vs total disk space if a space trigger warning is reached:

.. code-block::

    [fs]
    warning=70
    warning_action=echo {{mnt_point}} {{used}}/{{size}} > /tmp/fs.alert

*Note*: you can use all the stats for the current plugin (see
https://github.com/nicolargo/glances/wiki/The-Glances-2.x-API-How-to for
the stats list)

Gateway to others services
==========================

CSV
---

It is possible to export statistics to CSV file.

.. code-block:: console

    $ glances --export-csv /tmp/glances.csv

CSV file description:
- Stats description (first line)
- Stats (others lines)

InfluxDB
--------

You can export statistics to an ``InfluxDB`` server (time series server).
The connection should be defined in the Glances configuration file as
following:

.. code-block::

    [influxdb]
    host=localhost
    port=8086
    user=root
    password=root
    db=glances

and run Glances with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ glances --export-influxdb

InfluxDB 0.9.x also supports an optional tags configuration parameter 
specified as comma separated, key:value pairs. For example:

.. code-block::

    [influxdb]
    host=localhost
    port=8086
    user=root
    password=root
    db=glances
    tags=foo:bar,spam:eggs


For Grafana users, Glances provides a dedicated `dashboard`_. Just import
the file in your ``Grafana`` web interface.

.. image:: images/grafana.png

Statsd
------

You can export statistics to a ``Statsd`` server (welcome to Graphite!).
The connection should be defined in the Glances configuration file as
following:

.. code-block::

    [statsd]
    host=localhost
    port=8125
    prefix=glances

*Note*: the prefix option is optional ('glances by default')

and run Glances with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ glances --export-statsd

Glances will generate stats as:

.. code-block::

    'glances.cpu.user': 12.5,
    'glances.cpu.total': 14.9,
    'glances.load.cpucore': 4,
    'glances.load.min1': 0.19,
    ...

RabbitMQ
--------

You can export statistics to an ``RabbitMQ`` server (AMQP Broker).
The connection should be defined in the Glances configuration file as
following:

.. code-block::

    [rabbitmq]
    host=localhost
    port=5672
    user=glances
    password=glances
    queue=glances_queue

and run Glances with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ glances --export-rabbitmq
